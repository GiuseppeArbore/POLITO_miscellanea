### Script

Hi, <name of the participant>. I am <name of the facilitator> and today we’re
asking people to try using a mobile app that we’re working on so we can se
whether it works as intended. I want to make clear that we are here to test the
Meow app, not you! You can’t do anything wrong here. As you use
e app, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say
what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinkig.

Please, fill out this document to give us permission to record what happens on
the screen and our conversation before starting the session. Do you have any
questions?

…
OK. Before we look at anything, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions
First your name, age and nationality.
What’s your occupation? What do you do all day?
What kind of mobile device (or devices) do you use, like smartphones or a
tablet?
What is your level of familiarity with apps for travelers?
How often do you travel?

…  
\[START the recording\!\]
The app is designed to help solo travelers (or anyone) discover something 
to do during free time, and meet new people during their trip.

Now I’m going to ask you to try doing some specific tasks:

T1 -> See the details of the Turin event "Art Exhibition"
T2 -> Read information about the ice-breaker in the FAQ of the application 
T3 -> Join an indoor event with local participants 
T4 -> Check the starting hour for the event near the Po
T5 -> Join an event in Bari for tomorrow 
T6 -> Leave the "Karaoke" event
T7 -> Obtain the certification as an expert user for Bari
T8 -> Start an ice-breaker activity for an event you are attending today
